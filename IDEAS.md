App Logics

Now first the app should have a Splash page

another page with a simple drop down which contains the officers names
#
now when an officer name is selected, and Open/Enter/Login button is clicked, it should take the officer to the main page, that he/she can add a customer details then upon clicking add.... the info should be inserted into...the database

Now Create another page, that contains a listview to view all the customers from the officers database......

in all we need to have 3 pages..

create components to add, delete, and edit customer info... all should be a dialog....
